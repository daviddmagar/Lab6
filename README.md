My intitial code was written in a much  more consice and structured manner than the automatically generated umple code.
My code was also much shorter and to the point.
However, the umple generated code had a lot more errorr catching and was a more complete code than mine, given the parameters presented to it.

Umple seems to be a good tool to draw out flowcharts of your classes, methods, and variables, but the generation leave a lot to be desired.
Visualizing the code is useful, but other tools would probably be better suited for this cause due to the overall clunkiness of Umple.
All in all, while a umple can be a useful, I feel its actual use should be quite limited.
